Here's a detailed sequence diagram based on the code analysis output, formatted as a Mermaid diagram:

```

This diagram illustrates the flow of method calls in the codebase and highlights dependencies between components. The diagram is based on the information provided in the code analysis output, which includes the functions called, their relationships, and the number of total files with errors, functions analyzed, and call relationships.
